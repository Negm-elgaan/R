# Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each of the inputs
# of Race1 for men in the decade between the ages of 40 and 49. Remember
# that this age group is coded 40-49, which includes a space
# before 40. Sort the resulting table from the lowest average to the
# highest average systolic blood pressure. Use the filter functions,
# group_by, summarize, arrange and the pipe |> to do this in a single line
# of code. Inside summarize, save the mean and standard deviation
# of systolic blood pressure as average and standard_deviation.
