# Here is an example of how to create a character vector with the example of
#food that we will call food.
food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")

# Generate a character vector called city to store names
# of cities
# Make sure you follow the same order as in the instructions
city <- c("Beijing","Lagos","Paris","Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan","Toronto")
