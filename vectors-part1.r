# Here is an example on how to create a numerical vector with the costs called cost
cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)

# Create a numeric vector to store the temperatures listed in the
# instructions in a vector called temp
# Make sure you follow the same order in the instructions
temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)
